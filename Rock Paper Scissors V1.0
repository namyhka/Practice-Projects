# My own rock paper scissors program after learning the basic of python - loops, functions, if/elif/else statements. Needs some work but works
# Some variables I need defined before starting my program.

# Rules
# 1.) Game is your typical Rock Paper Scissors game
# 2.) There are 3 rounds. If there is a draw, the round repeats.
# 3.) Rock, Paper, Scissors are the only valid hands. Invalid hands will cause round to repeat
# 4.) The program asks the player if they want to play again. If yes, game repeats. Program ends when player answers no.
